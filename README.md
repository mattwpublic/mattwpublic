# Projects:

- I am currently working on a game with a [small team of friends](https://github.com/plagueremedygames). We don't currently have much information to give about it, but it started as a game jam submission for [this gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/pirate) on January 12th.
  The game page is [here](https://shizbibbit.itch.io/the-investorcist) and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/plagueremedygames/demo-source-code). I have learned a lot from this project so far, but mainly that I should think more slowly about my code, as well as doing more refactoring when possible.
  The demo code is not currently something that I am proud of, but hopefully that can change as we continue development, because we are scrapping the old project and starting over in Godot with some new ideas in mind.
  
- When I have time, I am also making a game on my own that I don't have a solid name for yet, but it is a multiplayer arena shooter. My goal is to create something with very optimized netcode and performance to hopefully make it esports-ready. I have an extremely bare-bones prototype build that was created in unity, mainly just to try my hand at multiplayer, and it works, but I am switching game engines so it has to be scrapped. I will try to record some footage with some friends to prove that it is multiplayer at some point, but in the mean time [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEThIFqJUFc) is an example video of what I had been working on so far.

- I've also uploaded my old work from highschool and from my time at Marquette University. In highschool, we worked on a lot of development in Java, as well as some basic things in C# using some .net libraries. In my free time, I created a small 3D rendering engine because I wanted to make a video game from scratch. This was the same game that evolved into the one previously mentioned. At Marquette, I took an intro to software development class that was taught in python.
